# TaxiRevenueOptimizer_Statistical_Analysis_and_A-B_Testing

This project dives deep into statistical analysis and A/B testing techniques to uncover insights into the relationship between payment methods (credit card vs. cash) and fare amounts in the taxi industry. Discover how data analytics can drive revenue optimization strategies for taxi cab drivers. Join us on this analytical journey.

## Project Overview

In this project, we delve into the realm of statistical analysis, focusing on fundamental concepts such as descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing. The objective is to explore provided data, conduct A/B tests, and interpret the results. Specifically, we aim to investigate the relationship between payment types (credit card vs. cash) and fare amounts in the context of taxi cab services.

## Business Understanding

The project revolves around demonstrating expertise in preparing, creating, and analyzing A/B tests. The primary goal is to identify strategies to increase revenue for taxi cab drivers. We operate under the assumption that the sample data originates from an experiment where customers are randomly assigned to two groups: those required to pay with credit cards and those required to pay with cash. Causal conclusions about how payment methods affect fare amounts are drawn based on this assumption.

## Data Understanding

- **Part 1: Imports and Data Loading**

  The project starts by loading necessary data packages for hypothesis testing and preparing for the analysis.

- **Part 2: Conduct EDA and Hypothesis Testing**

  Descriptive statistics are computed to gain insights into the dataset. The null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis are formulated to guide the hypothesis testing process.

  - *How did computing descriptive statistics help you analyze your data?*

  - *How did you formulate your null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis?*

## Modeling and Evaluation

The core of the project involves conducting A/B tests and deriving meaningful conclusions from the results.

## Conclusion

- **Part 3: Communicate Insights with Stakeholders**

  Key business insights derived from the A/B test results are communicated, providing valuable recommendations to stakeholders based on the outcomes of the analysis.

  - *What key business insight(s) emerged from your A/B test?*

  - *What business recommendations do you propose based on your results?*
